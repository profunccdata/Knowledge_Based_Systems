## Chapter 6:  Bayes Classifier on Cloud Dataproc
<p>Google Cloud Dataproc makes it convenient to spin up a Hadoop cluster that is capable of running MapReduce, Pig, Hive, and Spark.  In this chapter, we create3 a Bayesian model to predict the likely arrival delay of a flight.  We will use an integrated workflow that involves Bigquery, Spark SQL, and Apache Pig.  A Bayesian model will be used to predict the likely arrival delay of a flight<p>
  <p>Along the way we we learn how to create, resize, and delete job-specific Hadoop clusters using Cloud Dataproc.</p>
  
### A Gentle Introduction to Bayes Theorem for Machine Learning
#### Bayes Theorem
<p>Classification is a predictive modeling problem that involves assigning a label to a given new data sample input. For our case study, we want to know if our flight will be late or not based on what we know at the time we can make a decision to cancel</p>

<p>Analytics Vidhya has an excellent introduction to Bayes and it does not avoid the statistics behind the theorem.  As data scientists, we need to know the statistics behind our models but there is no reason to make it overly complicated!  I think you will like this article on Analytics Vidhya:</p>

#### Scikit Learn Documentation for Naive Bayes
  <p>The sklearn.naive_bayes module implements Naive Bayes algorithms. These are supervised learning methods based on applying Bayesâ€™ theorem with strong (naive) feature independence assumptions.</p>
