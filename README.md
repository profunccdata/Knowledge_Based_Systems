## Chapter 6:  Bayes Classifier on Cloud Dataproc
<p>Google Cloud Dataproc makes it convenient to spin up a Hadoop cluster that is capable of running MapReduce, Pig, Hive, and Spark.  In this chapter, we create3 a Bayesian model to predict the likely arrival delay of a flight.  We will use an integrated workflow that involves Bigquery, Spark SQL, and Apache Pig.  <p>
  <p>Along the way we we learn how to create, resize, and delete job-specific Hadoop clusters using Cloud Dataproc.</p>
